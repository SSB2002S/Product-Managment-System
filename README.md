# 🛒 Product Management System

**Product Management System** is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows you to efficiently manage your products. With this system, you can:

- Add new products
- Set prices, taxes, ads, and discounts
- Categorize products by type

All of this is managed through an interactive and modern user interface that supports Arabic and utilizes [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for clean and easy-to-understand alert messages.
